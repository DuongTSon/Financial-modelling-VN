# Applied financial modelling

This repository is created for sharing quantitative models which I have developed at a financial institution in Vietnam. Models are written in R programming language and web applications are hosted on shinyapps.io. I share both data and R code so people interested in those models can test, modify and contribute to this project. All materials are free.

Hope this project could foster free education in quantitative finance!

## Models
The repository so far contains:
- Multifactor risk model
- ARFIMA-GARCH
- Vector Autoregeressive Model (VAR)
- Vector Error Correction Model (VECM)

### Arbitrage pricing theory and factor models
