# Applied financial modelling

<<<<<<< HEAD
This repository is created for sharing quantitative models which I have developed at a financial institution in Vietnam. Models are written in **R programming language**, some are built on **Visual Basics for Application (VBA)** and web applications are hosted on **shinyapps.io**. I share both data and R code so people interested in those models can test, modify or contribute to this project. All materials are free.

Hope this project could foster free education in quantitative finance!
